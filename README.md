# WH-Army-List-Maker
Warhammer 40K List Maker

I like using battlescribe and new recruit but I wanted the option of changing looks and add some quality of life like units or equipment having an image linked to them so it is easier to figure out what is what.

Please make not that:

Warhammer 40K and associated content is the property of Games Workshop.

This project is intended only for personal use.

This project is very much a work in progress.

Any rules that are changed by GW will take a while to be updated.

I can not guarantee that the data and anything else in the project will always be up to date.
